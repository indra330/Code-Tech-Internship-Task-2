# Code-Tech-Internship-Task-2
1. Architecture of the MERN Stack E-commerce Website
Frontend: React.js
Role: React provides a dynamic and responsive interface for users to browse products, manage their shopping cart, and proceed to checkout.
Features:
Product Listings: Displays all products dynamically fetched from the backend.
Product Details: Shows individual product descriptions, images, and pricing.
Shopping Cart: Allows users to add/remove items and adjust quantities.
Checkout: Handles user details and order submission.
State Management:
Use Redux or React's Context API for global state management (cart, user authentication).
Use Axios to handle API calls for fetching and updating data.
Backend: Node.js + Express.js
Role: The backend manages user authentication, product and order data, and communication with the database.
API Endpoints:
Products:
GET /api/products: Retrieve a list of all products.
GET /api/products/:id: Retrieve details of a specific product.
Cart:
POST /api/cart: Save the user’s shopping cart.
GET /api/cart: Fetch the saved cart.
Orders:
POST /api/orders: Process a new order.
GET /api/orders/:id: Retrieve details of an order.
Authentication:
POST /api/auth/register: Register a new user.
POST /api/auth/login: Authenticate an existing user.
Database: MongoDB
Role: MongoDB stores product details, user data, and orders in flexible collections.
Collections:
Products:
Fields: name, description, price, category, image, stock, etc.
Users:
Fields: username, email, password (hashed), address, etc.
Orders:
Fields: userId, products (array of product IDs and quantities), totalPrice, status, etc.
2. Features of the E-commerce Website
Frontend Features
Homepage: Displays a list of featured products and categories.
Product Listing:
Shows all products with pagination or infinite scrolling.
Allows users to filter products by category, price range, etc.
Product Details:
Displays product name, description, price, stock availability, and "Add to Cart" button.
Shopping Cart:
Shows selected items with the ability to update quantities or remove products.
Dynamically updates the total price.
Checkout:
Collects user information (name, address, payment details).
Sends the order to the backend for processing.
User Authentication:
Login/Register functionality.
Dashboard to view order history.
Backend Features
RESTful APIs:
Handles requests from the frontend for product, cart, and order management.
Secure Authentication:
Implements JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure user login and session management.
Error Handling:
Proper error handling for invalid inputs, authentication errors, etc.
Order Processing:
Validates stock availability and updates product quantities.
Database Features
Flexible Schema:
MongoDB’s NoSQL structure allows for dynamic fields (e.g., adding new attributes to products).
Scalable Data Storage:
Efficiently handles growing product catalogs and user data.
Relational-Like Queries:
Uses references and aggregation pipelines for complex queries (e.g., order histories).
3. Step-by-Step Flow of the Website
Frontend Flow
User Browses Products:
Fetches product data from the backend API (/api/products).
User Adds Products to Cart:
Cart state updates dynamically and stores product details locally or via an API call (POST /api/cart).
User Proceeds to Checkout:
Cart details and user information are sent to the backend API (POST /api/orders).
Order Confirmation:
Backend processes the order and sends confirmation to the user.
Backend Flow
API Request Handling:
Product, cart, or order requests are routed to appropriate endpoints in Express.
Database Interaction:
MongoDB queries retrieve or update product, cart, and order data.
Authentication:
Secure login and registration using JWT for session tokens.
Order Processing:
Validates stock availability and deducts quantities for purchased items.
4. Technical Implementation
Frontend (React.js)
State Management:
Use Redux for managing cart and user states globally.
Dynamic Routing:
Use react-router-dom for navigation between pages (e.g., /products/:id for product details).
Styling:
Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for responsive design.
Backend (Node.js + Express.js)
API Structure:
Group related routes for better organization (e.g., /api/products, /api/orders).
Middleware:
Use body-parser for parsing incoming JSON requests.
Use cors for enabling cross-origin resource sharing.
Secure Authentication:
Hash passwords using bcrypt.js.
Use JWT for user authentication and session management.
